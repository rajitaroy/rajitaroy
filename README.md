I'm currently pursuing Bachelor's in Computer Engineering and Honours in Data Science. I love solving problems, interacting with fellow coders, learning and exploring various fields of the domain, with a special interest in Neural Networks lately. 

<ul>
  <li> Currently learning Tensorflow, Django and ReactJS </li>
  <li> Next project idea: Mask detection </li>
  <li> Future learning includes working with ChartJS and Dash
</ul>
